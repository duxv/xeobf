# Xeobf

A Go source obfuscator, originally intended to obfuscate the XENA project, but can be used anywhere. Support is only garranted for the XENA Apep client at the moment. Please make sure that you have a valid Go code, either way it will not work properly. Currently not working with escape characters.

Project still not working, uploaded only to show the developmental workflow.
